\section{Application in the General Social Survey}
\label{sec:gss}

\inlinetodo{Make sure that all referenced results are still true with new categorization}

% \subsection{Data and Meethods}

We now apply our techniques to the General Social Survey---a bi-annual poll of the American public on a broad variety of social, political, and idological topics administered by NORC at the University of Chicago \parencite{gss}.
Because the GSS asks many of the same questions year after year, it provides a good setting to apply the techniques developed over the previous two sections to probe the evolution of public ideological polarization.

I restrict to questions that have been asked repeatedly over the past three decades and manually categorize questions into one of nine topics: abortion, affirmative action, free speech, government spending, police, race, sex and birth control, welfare, and miscellaneous.
For each category, \cref{sec:gss-questions} enumerates the selected survey questions, their text, and the possible responses.

To encode survey responses as numeric values to which I can apply my polarization measure, I map the minimum response to -1, the maximum response to +1, and the remaining responses evenly-spaced between those two values.
For example, binary quesetions are encoded as $\pm 1$ and questions with three options are mapped into $(-1, 0, +1)$.
This handles all questions for which the responses are binary or admit some ordinal structure (e.g. rating one's agreement with a statement).
I only include questions fall under one of these categories.%
\footnote{A future version of this working paper will explore the impact of different methods of numerically encoding survey responses (e.g., using quantiles).}
To deal with missingness (arising from people electing not to answer a survey question), I estimate each entry of the covariance matrix using all pairs for which both issues contain a response.%
\footnote{
	The number of missing responses is in general very small, so there is little room for this choice to introduce bias in our results.
	Additionally, to affect any of our trends, this bias would have to dynamically evolve over time.
	This does allow the possibility of a non-PSD covariance estimate, but the probability of this vanishes as $n \to \infty$.

\subsection{Overall Trends}
\label{sec:overall-trends}

\autoref{fig:gss-time-series} shows how polarization---as measured by the spectral radius---evolves over time for the nine previously-mentioned issue groups.
%
Polarization on sex and birth control, affirmative action, police, and welfare rise steadily throughout our entire period.
%
Polarization surrounding government spending also rises throughout, but exhibits more volitility.
In particular, there are large spikes during the mid 1990s,\footnote{
	This spike is entirely due to polarization amongst Republicans; see \cref{fig:gss-within-party}.
} the 2008 financial crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Polarization on race issues drops steadily throughout 1990s and 2000s before turning around and beginning to increase again around 2012. By 2021, polarization sits 20 percent higher than its 1990 level.
%
Polarization on free speech drops fairly steadily for the first three decades of our period before percipitously falling nearly 20 percent during the late 2010s and early 2020s.

\subsection{Dimensional Collapse or Increase in General Disagreement?}
\label{sec:trace-concentration-decomp}

In \cref{sec:trace-concentration}, I demonstrated a decomposition of the spectral radius into the trace of the covariance matrix (summarizing the total disagreement, irrespective correctional structure) times the share of variance explained by the first principal component (summarizing the degree to which opinions are correlated across issues).
I now explore which of these two components is driving the observed trends.
Are increases in polarization stemming from people becoming increasingly one dimensional in their opinions, or are people simply disagreeing more in general?

To determine the proportion of change attributable to dimensional collapse, I fix the total variance component of \autoref{eq:percent-change-trace-concentration} to its initial value and let only the spectral concentration evolve over time. To see the change attributable to increase in total variance, I fix the spectral concentration to its initial value and let only the total variance evolve. These two counterfactuals multiply together to equal the true observed change. \cref{fig:gss-spectral-concentration} illustrates the results.

In general, most trends are driven by increases in total variance with spectral concentration even decreasing over time in some cases (e.g. police).
The most obvious exceptions to this trend are (1) race issues, which have exhibited a sharp uptick in spectral concentraion over the last decade and (2) abortion issues, which exhibit a ``U'' shape with total variance increasing from 1990 until around 2010 before decreasing sharply from 2010 until the present.

\subsection{Within or Between Political Parties?}
\label{sec:party-decomp}

\Cref{sec:between-v-within} developed a way to decompose polarization into a component stemming from within-group disagreement and a component stemming from between-group disagreement.
This subsection applies that technique to the GSS.

As a first step, we can investigate levels and trends of polarization \emph{within} political party.
\cref{fig:gss-within-party} shows these results.
We counterintuitively find that within-party polarization is typically comparable to---and in some cases higher than---polarization in the general population.
Democrats are generally more polarized on police, race and affirmative action and are united on welfare and spending issues.
Republicans are polarized on spending and sex and united on policing, race, and affirmative action.
%
Interestingly, this exercise also reveals how both bump in spending polarization during the 1990s and the spike in police-related polarization post George Floyd are driven by disagreement \emph{within} the Republican party.%
\footnote{
	Party is obviously endogenous to one's political and ideological beliefs, so results from this section should all be taken with a grain of salt.
	We also present results by self-reported idology (liberal v. conservative) in \autoref{sec:other-decompositions}.
}

We then leverage the framework of \cref{sec:between-v-within} to decompose changes in polarization into those attributable to within- and between-group trends.
We find that the breakdown varies across topic:
Trends in free speech and police polarization are driven entirely by within-party changes.
Trends in polarization on race and welfare issues are driven entirely by between-party changes.
Interestingly, spending polarization exhibits a ``switch'': Volatility in the 1990s and in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis stemmed from within-party disagreement, but the COVID-19 spending polarization bump was driven by between-party differences.
This is in line with a more broad pattern of an uptick in between-party polarization in the last five years.
\Cref{fig:gss-within-v-between} shows these results.

\subsection{What About Gender? Age? Race? Religion?}

If the divergence of political parties is not entirely to blame for increasing polarization, are there other demographic characteristics that explain the increases?
%
For example, is increasing polarization on race issues being driven by divergence of the opinions of white and black people?
Are increases in abortion polarization being driven by a divergence of men's and women's views?
It appears that in the vast majority of cases, the answer is no---most trends stem from within-group changes, not divergence of opinions across groups.
Two notable exceptions are that education and religion explain a large chunk of the increase in abortion polarization.
See \cref{sec:other-decompositions} for analogues to \cref{fig:gss-within-party,fig:gss-within-v-between}, replacing political party with race, sex, religion, education, geography, age, and other demographics.
