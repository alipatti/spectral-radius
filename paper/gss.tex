\section{Application in the General Social Survey}

\subsection{Data}

We use the General Social Survey from NORC at the University of Chicago \cite{gss}.

\subsection{Methods}

Categories are produced manually.

See \autoref{sec:gss-questions} for the questions.

We estimate

\subsection{Overall Trends}
\label{sec:overall-trends}

\begin{itemize}
	\item abortion highly polarized, hasn't changed much
	\item race polarization decreasing until around 2012, then enormous spike (dropping a bit post-covid)
	\item sex/BC, welfare, police increasing at steady rate
	\item spending polarization peaks in the 90s, 2008, covid
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dimensional Collapse or Increase in Total Variance?}
\label{sec:trace-concentration-decomp}

\inlinetodo{How do we calculate this?}

\inlinetodo{initial decompositions (add in facet strip?)}

\begin{itemize}
	\item abortion has odd u shape
	\item police entirely driven by total variance (concentration has decreased)
	\item racial polarization entirely driven by dimensional collapse (total variance decreased)
	\item others (welfare, sex, speech, etc.) are a mix
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Within or Between Political Parties?}
\label{sec:party-decomp}

It's

Using the within-versus between group decomposition outlined in \autoref{sec:between-v-within}

\

We fix one of the components 

By doing this, 

by party:
\begin{itemize}
	\item democrats are polarized on police, race, affirmative action and unified on welfare and spending
	\item republicans are more polarized on spending and sex, unified on police, race, affirmative action
	\item republicans drive spending polarization bumps in 1990s
	\item democrat polarization drops post covid for race, abortion, and sex/bc
	\item polarization on police shoots up for republicans post-covid
\end{itemize}

\inlinetodo{initial decompositions (add in facet strip?)}

change decomp:
\begin{itemize}
	\item abortion shows party convergence post-covid (driven by democrats)
	\item speech, police changes entirely driven by within
	\item race, welfare changes entirely driven by between
\end{itemize}

Party is endogenous to one's beliefs, so this should all be taken with a grain of salt.
We also present results by idology rather than party affiliation in \autoref{todo}.

\subsection{What About Gender? Age? Race? Religion?}

Is increasing polarization on race issues being driven by divergence of opinions of white and black people?
Increase in abortion polarization being driven by a divergence of men and women?
It appears that for these cases and in nearly every other case, the answer is no---nearly all trends have been driven by within-group increases in polarization not divergence of opinions across groups.
The notable exception is that education and religion are responsible for a decent chunk of the increase in abortion polarization.
See \autoref{sec:other-decompositions} for breakdowns by race, sex, religion, education, geography, age, and other demographics.
