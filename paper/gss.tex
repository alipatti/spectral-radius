\section{Application in the General Social Survey}

\subsection{Data}

We use the General Social Survey from NORC at the University of Chicago \cite{gss}.

\subsection{Methods}

Categories are produced manually.

See \autoref{sec:gss-questions} for the questions.

We estimate

\subsection{Overall Trends}
\label{sec:overall-trends}

\begin{itemize}
	\item abortion highly polarized, hasn't changed much
	\item race polarization decreasing until around 2012, then enormous spike (dropping a bit post-covid)
	\item sex/BC, welfare, police increasing at steady rate
	\item spending polarization peaks in the 90s, 2008, covid
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dimensional Collapse or Increase in Total Variance?}
\label{sec:trace-concentration-decomp}

\inlinetodo{initial decompositions (add in facet strip?)}

\begin{itemize}
	\item abortion has odd u shape
	\item police entirely driven by total variance (concentration has decreased)
	\item racial polarization entirely driven by dimensional collapse (total variance decreased)
	\item others (welfare, sex, speech, etc.) are a mix
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Within or Between Parties?}
\label{sec:party-decomp}

by party:
\begin{itemize}
	\item democrats are polarized on police, race, affirmative action and unified on welfare and spending
	\item republicans are more polarized on spending and sex, unified on police, race, affirmative action
	\item republicans drive spending polarization bumps in 1990s
	\item democrat polarization drops post covid for race, abortion, and sex/bc
	\item polarization on police shoots up for republicans post-covid
\end{itemize}

\inlinetodo{initial decompositions (add in facet strip?)}

change decomp:
\begin{itemize}
	\item abortion shows party convergence post-covid (driven by democrats)
	\item speech, police changes entirely driven by within
	\item race, welfare changes entirely driven by between
\end{itemize}

Breakdowns by other groups are presented in the appendix (race, region, education, gender).

Simply plug-in our covariance matrix estimators into \autoref{eq:norm-sigma-decomposition-final} and calculate $s$ as the residual term.
