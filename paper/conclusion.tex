\section{Conclusion}

Introduced and motivated a new measure of polarization in the general public that is broadly applicable to all sorts of data.
Showed several decomposition of measure with intuitive interpretations.

Showed using data from the General Social Survey that polarization in the general public has increased over the last three decades across a wide variety of topics.
This is contrary to general poli sci literature which generally holds that polarization has only increased among elites (e.g. politicians).

These changes are being driven by a variety of factors, both within and across political parties.
