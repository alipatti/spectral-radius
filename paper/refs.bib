        abstract = { We consider the numerical calculation of several matrix
                    eigenvalue problems which require some manipulation before
                    the standard algorithms may be used. This includes finding
                    the stationary values of a quadratic form subject to linear
                    constraints and determining the eigenvalues of a matrix which
                    is modified by a matrix of rank one. We also consider several
                    inverse eigenvalue problems. This includes the problem of
                    determining the coefficients for the Gauss–Radau and
                    Gauss–Lobatto quadrature rules. In addition, we study several
                    eigenvalue problems which arise in least squares. },

        abstract = { An algorithm is presented for computing the
                    eigendecomposition of a symmetric rank-one modification of a
                    symmetric matrix whose eigendecomposition is known. Previous
                    algorithms for this problem suffer a potential loss of
                    orthogonality among the computed eigenvectors, unless
                    extended precision arithmetic is used. This algorithm is
                    based on a novel, stable method for computing the
                    eigenvectors. It does not require extended precision and is
                    as efficient as previous approaches. },
